***NOTE: All the files are should be located in one folder only.

Firstly change directory of the dataset that you've stored in your device.

Then, run the "FACE MASK" file only in "SPYDER" Application.

After running the file, the model will get trained and a "JSON" file is created.
**NOTE: Do not forget to change the directory "json" & "h5" files directory.

Now run the "FACE MASK (JSON FILE CODE)" file so that a camera window is popped up detects the face and shows,
		
			i. "WITH MASK" if we're wearing mask.
		     ii. "WITHOUT MASK" if we're not wearing mask.
